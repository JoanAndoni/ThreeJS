# A6: Not Star Fox

Assignment No 6 for the computer graphics course.

Based on the Class demos, create a [Star Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox) style game. An example can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvT8SdZ5zf8).

The game must have the following:

- Load a 3D space ship. 
- The space ship can move in any direction except forward or backward.
- The ship must have life points.
- The ship must be able to shoot lasers. 
- There must be obstacles that the ship has to avoid. If the ship hits any of them, the life looses a set amount of life points. Load a 3D model for the obstacles.
- There must also be some objects that the ship is able to destroy. When one of such objects is destroyed, you gain a set amount of points. Load a 3D model for these objects.
- The obstacles and the destroyable object move towards the space ship indefinitely. When they reach a set point of the level, they are destroyed.
- The game ends when the ship has no life left, or when a set amount of time has passed.
- A score, and high score, must be recorded.
- Create a simple user interface, using html and css, to show the ship's life, score, timer, start and restart the game.

**Rubric:**

- The game was created as specified.
- Objects have bounding boxes, and are correctly handled according to the game's description.
- 3D models are loaded for the ship and scene objects.
- The ship correctly interacts with the environment as instructed.
- A high score and timer were correctly implemented.
- UI was correctly displayed.
